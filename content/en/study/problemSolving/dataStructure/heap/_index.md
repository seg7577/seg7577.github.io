    â†’ A heap is a binary tree data structure.
    
    â†’ The child nodes of the i-th node are located at the (i * 2 + 1)-th and (i * 2 + 2)-th nodes.
    
    â†’ The parent node of the i-th node is located at the (i - 1) / 2-th node.
    
    â†’ The parent node is always less than or equal to or greater than or equal to the child nodes.
    
    â†’ Looking at the tree in the picture above, the parent node follows the rule of being smaller than the child node. This structure is called a **min-heap**. If the parent node is larger than the child node, it is called a **max-heap**.
