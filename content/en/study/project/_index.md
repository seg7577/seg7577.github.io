## Overview

1. 🎶MATCH THE SONG🎶 (May 2023 - July 2023)
The MATCH THE SONG project is a quiz-style game where users listen to a short music clip and try to guess which song it is. Users must enter the song title or the artist's name within a limited time, and if they guess correctly, they earn points. This project provides an opportunity to test one’s music knowledge while enjoying various songs and exploring a wide range of genres and eras. The game includes challenges of varying difficulty levels, making it enjoyable for both beginners and music enthusiasts alike. This was my first team project, conducted during the Object-Oriented Programming course in the first semester of 2023. My role within the team involved writing the server and client code on the cloud and developing 1
communication. I focused on network programming and backend development throughout this project.

2. 📋Board📋 (July 2024 - August 2024)
The Board project is an online community platform where users can write posts and leave comments. Users can create posts on various topics and share their opinions by commenting on other users' posts. This project provides features for creating, editing, deleting, and commenting on posts, facilitating smooth communication among users. It also includes categorization and search functionality, making it easier for users to find relevant information. With its intuitive UI and efficient content management, the platform maximizes user experience. As my first personal project, I encountered many challenges, and the overall completeness was not very high. However, I gained valuable experience working with Spring, understanding the importance of versioning, and setting up various development environments.

3. 💼GitHub Pages Portfolio💼 (September 2024 - Ongoing)
This project helps developers or designers easily create and deploy their portfolio websites using GitHub Pages. It allows for free hosting of static websites and provides easy management and automatic updates via GitHub repositories. Users can showcase their career, projects, and tech stack on the website, making it accessible to anyone worldwide through GitHub’s convenient deployment system. Integrated with static site generators like Jekyll, users can easily create content using Markdown files, even without programming knowledge. This project is currently in progress and is part of a class assignment, but I plan to keep updating it after the assignment is complete. Through this project, I have focused on learning the overall structure of frontend development
