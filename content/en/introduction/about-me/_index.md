## Hi😀
I am Minseok Kwon, a student majoring in Computer Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I am primarily interested in full-stack development and cloud computing, and I am studying the latest web technologies and cloud architectures. I am gaining experience in both backend and frontend development in order to become a full-stack developer. Through team projects and personal endeavors, I aim to solve practical problems and am always open to new challenges. On my website, I share various articles related to development, as well as my hobbies and personal interests.
