    - Plot

        "Nevertheless" is a K-drama adapted from a popular webtoon, exploring the complexities of love and attraction in the modern world. The story centers on Yoo Na-bi (Han So-hee), a woman who has lost faith in love due to a painful relationship, yet still yearns for the warmth of romance. She meets Park Jae-eon (Song Kang), a charming and free-spirited man who enjoys casual relationships without emotional attachment. Despite his indifferent attitude toward love, Na-bi finds herself drawn to him, and their relationship becomes a delicate balance of desire, uncertainty, and emotional tension.

    - Review

        "Nevertheless" is a delicate portrayal of modern relationships, filled with emotional nuance and a realistic depiction of love’s complexities. The drama successfully captures the thrill, confusion, and heartache that come with navigating uncertain relationships, and this is most evident in the chemistry between the lead characters, Yoo Na-bi and Park Jae-eon.

        Han So-hee delivers a compelling performance as Yoo Na-bi, a woman torn between the fear of getting hurt again and the irresistible pull of attraction. Her portrayal of a vulnerable, yet strong character adds depth to Na-bi’s internal struggle, making her journey through the series relatable and poignant. Song Kang plays Park Jae-eon, a charismatic but emotionally distant man. His character is shrouded in mystery, and while he initially comes across as aloof, Song Kang effectively conveys the complex layers of Jae-eon’s personality.

        One of the standout elements of the drama is its cinematography and aesthetic. Set against the backdrop of an art school, the series beautifully incorporates art into its storytelling. The use of soft lighting, thoughtful camera angles, and artistic imagery helps to create an intimate and visually pleasing experience, reflecting the characters’ emotions. Each scene is carefully crafted to enhance the mood, from the soft blush of a romantic moment to the shadowy uncertainty of their complex feelings.

        The slow and deliberate pacing of the show allows viewers to dive deep into the emotional tension between Na-bi and Jae-eon. Every glance, every touch is loaded with meaning, creating an atmosphere of palpable tension and longing. Their relationship, built on fleeting moments and unspoken words, captures the uncertainty of modern romance, where clear definitions and boundaries are often blurred.

        However, "Nevertheless" does have its drawbacks. While the early episodes build intrigue and excitement, some viewers may find that the story loses momentum in the latter half. The repetitive nature of Na-bi and Jae-eon’s relationship dynamic – their continuous push and pull without significant growth – can become frustrating. At times, it feels as if the characters are stuck in a cycle of indecision, leaving the audience craving more development and resolution.

        Despite these pacing issues, the show remains a strong commentary on the emotional complexity of modern-day relationships. It explores themes of casual love, emotional vulnerability, and the desire for connection, all while remaining grounded in reality. The characters’ indecisiveness and emotional turmoil reflect the confusion many experience in the pursuit of love.

    - Overall

        "Nevertheless" is a thoughtful, visually stunning drama that delves into the nuances of modern romance. Han So-hee and Song Kang deliver strong performances, bringing their characters’ emotional struggles to life. Although the pacing may feel slow and repetitive at times, the show’s realistic portrayal of love’s complexities, coupled with its aesthetic beauty, makes it a captivating watch for those who enjoy introspective romantic dramas.

    - Plot

        "My Name" is a gripping crime thriller that follows the story of Yoon Ji-woo (Han So-hee), a young woman seeking revenge for her father’s brutal murder. After witnessing her father’s death, Ji-woo is consumed by a desire for vengeance. She turns to Choi Mu-jin (Park Hee-soon), a powerful crime lord and her father’s former associate, who takes her under his wing. Mu-jin helps Ji-woo infiltrate the police force under a new identity, where she works as an undercover agent to uncover the truth behind her father’s murder. As Ji-woo navigates the dangerous world of both the criminal underworld and the police, her loyalty is tested, and she faces the harsh reality of betrayal, violence, and her own internal conflict.

    - Review

        "My Name" is a gritty, intense drama that blends action, crime, and revenge into a powerful narrative. One of the show’s key strengths lies in its raw portrayal of violence and the emotional toll it takes on its characters, particularly Yoon Ji-woo, played by Han So-hee. Known for her more delicate roles, Han So-hee takes on a darker, more complex character in this series, showcasing her versatility as an actress. Ji-woo’s transformation from a grieving daughter into a fierce, unstoppable force of revenge is both compelling and heartbreaking.

        The action sequences in "My Name" are some of the most intense seen in K-drama. The fight choreography is brutal and realistic, capturing the high stakes of Ji-woo’s mission. Whether it’s hand-to-hand combat or high-octane chase scenes, the action is relentless and visually gripping. Ji-woo’s journey is marked by physical and emotional battles, and Han So-hee’s dedication to the physically demanding role shines through in every scene.

        Park Hee-soon delivers a chilling performance as Choi Mu-jin, the enigmatic and calculating crime boss who serves as both Ji-woo’s mentor and potential adversary. His character walks a fine line between protector and manipulator, keeping viewers on edge as his true motivations are slowly revealed. Mu-jin’s relationship with Ji-woo is a complex one, filled with power dynamics, trust, and betrayal, adding depth to the already intense storyline.

        While the plot revolves around revenge, "My Name" also explores deeper themes of identity and loyalty. Ji-woo’s double life as both a police officer and a member of a criminal syndicate creates internal conflict. As she gets closer to the truth about her father’s death, she must also confront her own moral boundaries and question where her loyalty truly lies. This inner struggle adds emotional depth to the action-packed narrative, making Ji-woo a character who is not only driven by revenge but also by the search for her own identity.

        The show’s pacing is fast, with twists and turns in nearly every episode. The tension is palpable, and the sense of danger is ever-present, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. However, while the intensity of the action is well-executed, the show does fall into some familiar revenge-thriller tropes. The plot can be somewhat predictable at times, and certain character developments, particularly in the supporting cast, feel underdeveloped. That said, the central performances and high-stakes action more than compensate for these minor shortcomings.

        Visually, "My Name" is dark and atmospheric, with a moody color palette that enhances the show’s grim tone. The use of lighting and shadow plays a significant role in reflecting Ji-woo’s descent into the darker corners of her mission. The production design and cinematography work hand-in-hand to create an immersive experience, making the world of crime and corruption feel all the more menacing.

    - Overall

        "My Name" is a hard-hitting, action-packed revenge drama that showcases Han So-hee’s remarkable range as an actress. The show offers thrilling fight scenes, an intense plot, and a dark exploration of loyalty, identity, and betrayal. While it doesn’t stray far from the typical revenge narrative, its well-executed action sequences, strong performances, and emotional depth make it a standout in the crime thriller genre.
